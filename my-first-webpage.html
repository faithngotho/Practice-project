  <li><h2>HIDE AND SEEK</h2></li>
  <p>Hide and seek is a game that has been around forever and that is because it is simple and fun! All you need to do is hide somewhere either inside or outside and then call for your dog which will usually get a quick excited response. Some dogs will run all over looking until they see you, others will use their nose to sniff you out but no matter what it is a fun time that gets their brain and their body working. This is a good game for dogs who you want to get active but they are not as mobile as they once were.<p>
    <li><h2>CUP SHUFFLE</h2></li>
  <p>This game much like hide and seek has been around a while and it is great for dogs to practice their scent smelling abilities. This will require three cups that cannot be seen through and a couple of treats. Simply place a treat under a cup and keep the other two empty, then switch the cups around while keeping the treat hidden until you think your dog has lost track of the treat. Once this happens allow your dog to pick one of the cups and reward them if they are right.<p>

<h2>HISTORY OF THE SIBERIAN HUSKY</h2>
<p>

The Siberian Husky is believed to have originated among a tribe of Siberian nomads, the Chukchi. DNA tests have confirmed that Siberian Huskies are one of the oldest dog breeds, making their history pretty unknown. With this, it is known that the Chukchi used the Siberian Huskies for faster transportation in the cold weather. An even more important use of the Huskies is how helpful they were to families. For example, they slept with children to provide warmth and comfort in the cold weather and were able to help doing heavy labor around the house, like transporting things. In 1908, the Siberian Husky moved to Alaska and were used as sled dogs during the Gold Rush. Once they moved to Alaska, they became part of the All-Alaska Sweepstakes, which is a 408-mile dog sled race which is still continued today with the Huskies. The Siberian Club of America was founded in 1938 and the Siberian Husky was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1930.</p>
